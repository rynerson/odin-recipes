         <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This is a simple vanilla cupcakes recipe I found on Allrecipes. Vanilla cupcakes
            are often wildly popular at birthday parties, but can be enjoyed any time of the year.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>

              <li>3/4 cup superfine sugar</li>
              <li>2/3 cup butter, softened</li>
              <li>3 large eggs</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cups self-rising flour</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Gather all ingredients. 
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
              <li> Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
                Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. </li>
              <li>Beat in vanilla extract. 
                Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. </li>
              <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. 
                Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
            </ol>
